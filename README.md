# Discord Fake Typer

Fake Typer is a simple tool that simulates typing in a Discord server channel using bot tokens. The bot reads tokens from a `tokens.txt` file and sends messages continuously in the specified channel. An executable version (.exe) is also available for easier usage.

## Features

- Simulates typing in a Discord channel
- Reads bot tokens from a `tokens.txt` file
- Easy to set up and use
- Standalone executable available

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (for the script version)
- Discord API library (like `discord.py`)

## Installation

### Script Version

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AxZeRxD/Discord-fake-typer
   cd Discord-fake-typer
   ```



3. Create a `tokens.txt` file in the project directory and add your bot tokens, one per line.
